        The fez (Turkish: fes, plural fezzes or fezes[1]), as well as its equivalent, the tarboosh (Arabic: طربوش‎ / Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: [tˤɑɾˈbuːʃ], ALA-LC: ṭarbūsh), is a felt hat of two types: either in the shape of a truncated cone made of red felt, or a short cylinder made of kilim fabric, both usually with a tassel attached to the top. <span>The tarboosh and the modern fez, which is similar</span>, owe much of their development and popularity to the Ottoman era.[2][3]
